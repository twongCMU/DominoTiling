DominoTiling
============

Randomly place k-tile dominos into an N-length array until no more tiles can be placed and determine the occupation percentage

I wrote this code for fun on my own time.

I wrote this code to illustrate the work that my dad, a math professor, and his student were doing. Their work was to determine a function that would return the expected percentage of tiles covered by randomly placing k-sized dominos on an N-length array until no more tiles could be placed.

This work was presented at the 2015 Joint Mathematics Meetings conference on January 13, 2015:
